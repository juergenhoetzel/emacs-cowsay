;;; Commentary:

;; This is a workalike of the popular `cowsay' amusement program that
;; runs directly in Emacs and does not require any external programs.
;; This port is not written by the original author of `cowsay', but
;; can load cartoon characters from the same files as the original.

;;; Code:

(defvar cowsay-directories '("/usr/local/share/cows")
  "List of directories to search for cow definition files.

Any directories listed in the COWPATH environment variable are
searched as well.")

(defvar cowsay-cows '()
  "List of cows that are available for use.

Each entry is a list whose first element is the cow name (a
string) and remaining elements are cow parts. A cow part is
either a string (which is inserted verbatim) or one of the
symbols 'eyes, 'thoughts, 'tongue.")

(defvar cowsay-preferred-cows '("www")
  "List of user's favorite cow names as strings.

When cowsay is called without asking for any particular cow, the
first loaded cow from this list is chosen by default. If none of
the preferred cows are loaded, the first in `cowsay-cows' wins.

Emacs Lisp code calling cowsay can temporarily override this
variable using (let ((cowsay-preferred-cows ...)) ...) to use
particular cows preferred by the program.")
